Assignment 1 DATA221

Question 1: After using the example structure, I made it so that a loop will keep running as up until the product it reaches or passes 100.

Question 2: For this question I just chose to do it in parts where I made it loop through each string, then followed by getting the length of the string and then another that 
will determine if the string is even or odd. Lastly, I just structured the result of the output.

Question 3: In this question I just made the empty list. Where a loop is begins through pairs (x,y). Then followed by ensuring that it would skip negatives, by having y only valid when > 0.

Question 4: With the starter code, it is followed with an empty list that stores the index that are greater than or equal to x. That is met with a condition that ensures that the index is 
greater than or equal to x. Then there is the prints that are asked of.

Question 5: I made sure I followed the requirements by making a function that will return invalid messages when comparing values. Ensuring that radii is both positive and an integer. 
Then included pi, where I will use to calculate each circle (small/big). Followed by the percentage of the large circle that the smaller circle covers. I also included a test output.

Question 6: Made sure that each key was unique, so I made it where there are no duplicates. This then loops through the value and counts how many numbers are less than or equal to the key. 
Where it follows with the percentage of the elements and is stored into the dictionary.

Question 7: The goal was to get hours, minutes, seconds and period, so ensured that input is set as an int. See and compare it to zero and observe if it acts like a number, 
then added invalid messages as asked. It was just then calculating each hour, minute and second. Then followed by determining whether it is AM or PM. 
And converting the 24hr clock into regular time.

Question 8: With the given code, I just created a DataFrame from the dictionary, and formatted the columns, and added a new column where I added A and C.
